# flatiron-frontend-phase1-project

My front-end phase1 project for Flatiron

## INSTALLATION

## DESCRIPTION

This is a fun spin on a random quotes generator. As a fan of the long running (a little too long if you ask me) show Supernatural, i've decided to create a hunters manual of sorts. The user will select from a set of buttons, corresponding to a category, which then accesses the object related to that monster and displays info on the screen. The info includes monster name, a bio, and a weakness. So should you come across one, you'll know how to send them packing!

## CONTRIBUTOR GUIDE

Contributions are welcome, whether you are a fan of the show and want to add more monsters to the list, or you may have a suggestion on how to take it up a notch or do something differently, I am open to it all.

PROJECT README GUIDELINES
