# flatiron-frontend-phase1-project

My front-end phase1 project for Flatiron (Hunter's Guide)

## INSTALLATION

To use this single page application, you will need to install and run json-server

### Install json server

npm install -g json-server

### Run the json server

json-server --watch db.json
Access the live db.json data here:
http://localhost:3000/supernaturalCreatures

## DESCRIPTION

This is a fun spin on a random quotes generator. As a fan of the long running (a little too long if you ask me) show Supernatural, i've decided to create a hunters manual of sorts. The manual includes creatures that have all made an appearance on the tv show. The lore and ways to banish them are displayed, as well as the episodes they are featured in. Maybe I will convert some of you to fans and/or prepare you for whatever next...however this is not a banishing aliens guide, which may be more helpful, given recent events!

## HOW TO USE

To interact with my single page application, you will first need to run the json server, refer to the installation instructions for project setup. Each time the SHOW ME THE MONSTERS BUTTON is pressed the monster data SHOULD populate.

## FUTURE PLANS FOR THIS PROJECT

    [X] Add more monster data
    [x] Add functionality to populate by category
    [x] Clean up the UI
    [x] Play around with more methods to generate, filter, and copy data

## CONTRIBUTOR GUIDE

Contributions are welcome, whether you are a fan of the show and want to add more monsters to the list, or you may have a suggestion on how to take it up a notch or do something differently, I am open to it all.
Fork and clone this repo, the db.json file is where I started adding monsters, feel free to add more. Have fun!

Download json-server following the installation instructions above and run json-server --watch db.json
