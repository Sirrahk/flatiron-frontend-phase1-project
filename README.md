# flatiron-frontend-phase1-project

My front-end phase1 project for Flatiron (Hunter's Guide)

## INSTALLATION

## DESCRIPTION

This is a fun spin on a random quotes generator. As a fan of the long running (a little too long if you ask me) show Supernatural, i've decided to create a hunters manual of sorts. The manual includes creatures of the urban legend, biblical, and monster types that have all made an appearance on the tv show. The lore and ways to banish them are displayed, as well as the episodes they are featured in. Maybe I will convert some of you to fans and/or prepare you for whatever next...however this is not a banishing aliens guide, which may be more helpful, given recent events!

## HOW TO USE

To interact with my single page application, you will first need to run the json server, refer to the installation instructions for project setup. Press a button correspoding to either MONSTER, BIBLICAL, OR URBAN LEGEND, and watch as a random entry is generated with all the information you need to know

## CONTRIBUTOR GUIDE

Contributions are welcome, whether you are a fan of the show and want to add more monsters to the list, or you may have a suggestion on how to take it up a notch or do something differently, I am open to it all.
