# flatiron-frontend-phase1-project

My front-end phase1 project for Flatiron

## DESCRIPTION

This is a fun spin on a random quotes generator. As a fan of the long running (a little too long if you ask me) show Supernatural, i've decided to create a hunters manual of sorts. The user will select from a set of buttons, corresponding to a category, which then accesses the object related to that monster and displays info on the screen. The info includes monster name, a bio, and a weakness. So should you come across one, you'll know how to send them packing!
